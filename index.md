## In brief
Initial upload to GitHub of some of my personal source code I had in other online repositories, or on various backup disks.  Much of which dates back to high school, compiled with Borland C/Watcom and the build system has not been updated since.  Please enjoy if any of it can be of value to you, and if you notice or suspect missing files, or new versions, feel free to reach out... perhaps I have a better backup, or updated code scattered around :/

Mind the gap.
